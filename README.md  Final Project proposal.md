# Final_project 


# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Melody Maker ðŸŽ¶ 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will be attempting to create a music maker composed of a mini piano on the side bar with 6-15 different keys. Also known as a MIDI or Musical Instrument Digital Interface. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will mostlikey be doing this project in vs code since I am most familiar with it or posibly ubntu if I run into too many issues along the way. My plan is to make a MIDI in python. This would be composed of a side bar of buttons that will be connected to different notes. When a space on the window is pressed within the 20 bars, it should save the note and play once you press finish. After pressing a number of notes, the user should have a new mini song/jingle they made. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I don't plan on using this for a different class. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I will be working alone on this project 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will for sure have atleast 4 keys of some sort that can produce sound. This project will for sure be a challenge. I haven't incorperated sound into any of the past coding projects i've done in the past but I feel confident that I can atleast do this much. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

7 pressable keys that can produce the correct coresponding notes when play is pressed. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In the best case senario, I'd have all keys on the f major scale including a few more and be able to possibly change instruments between 2 others. Also for a visual aspect, I'd like to make the buttons look like piano keys. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to research how to import sound and connecting it to my program. I already have a few articles & websites I've been following instructions from. I also need to see how to create the whole visual aspect of this project.
